For the theoratical highest score of k we can think of a solution where all connection are ridden excectly once.
The p value is therefore 1 and the time value is the total time of all connection and is 3201.
For the amount of trains needed we devide the total time by 180 and this gives 8,6 trains. meaning the lowest value for
is 9.

K = 1 * 10000 - (9 * 100 + 1551) = 7549
